If we look at the boxplots in Figure \ref{fig:boxplots} we especially notice that $Rcyl$ is higher for Migrators, both 1st quartile, the mean and the 3rd quartile. We note these as important predictors, which we will also discover in later analysis. We observe the same for $vphi$, although it isn't as clear. Generally it seems that stars with extreme values of any predictor tends to be a migrator.
