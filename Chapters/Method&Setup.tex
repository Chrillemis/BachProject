The dataset consists of 31 different predictors. These include simulated positions, velocities and atomic ratios of stars inside the milky way. It was generated by R. Roskar, V.P. Debattista,  S.R. Loebman, Z. Ivezic, T.R. Quinn.\cite{Roskar:2011ie}.

To evaluate the performance of different models, we sometimes use cross-entropy, since we have a classification problem. Cross entropy is used to select the best model when performing best subset-selection, although it is not possible to calculate cross-entropy for all of our models, since some do not produce a probability, but classifies wether or not the star is a migrator. To compare all of our models, we use the accuracy\textunderscore score() function from the Python library sklearn.metrcis, where we generally use the cutoff-value of 0.5 for the models, that predict a probability.
