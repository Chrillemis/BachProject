The models are not that far from the baseline of a model always guessing nomigrator. It seems it is very difficult to classify stars as migrators and it may be far more determined by other factors, such as how dense it's local environment is (or rather was), proximity to black holes etc. than the variables we accounted for in this study. 

A key factor to notice in our models is the fact that it is trained using simulation data, and we will never know how accurate our models really are on real world data, since it's impossible to measure migration of stars on our timescale. This will purely be a statistical tool that can point us in different directions for further study. It may even be possible that we are just fitting our models to simulation errors and that the predictions are completely unusable in the field.

Further study would be growing forests using all of the data and perhaps trying deeper layered neural networks, while keeping the amount of neurons per layer fairly low. Also training for a larger amount of epochs would help, and different optimizers could be tried. As goes for the tree based methods, training them on the full dataset would be a great start.
