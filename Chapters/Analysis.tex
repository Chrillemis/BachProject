Actually only two discrete solutions are impossible from the boundary of $h=4m$, with the smallest pipe diameters of $6$ and $12$-inches. This makes the solution with the smallest pipe diameter as $d=18inch$ and $h=1.75m$. Taking the large uncertainty on d into account, the new height would be $3.42m$.
